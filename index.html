    <h1>Counting Valleys And Mountains</h1>

    <div id="main">
        <div id="problem">
            <p>
                Gary is an avid hiker. 
                He tracks his hikes meticulously, paying close attention to small details like topography. 
                During his last hike, for every step he took, he noted if it was an uphill ('U') or a downhill ('D') step. 
                Gary's hikes start and end at sea level. 
                We define the following terms:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A <i>mountain</i> is a non-empty sequence of consecutive steps <i>above</i> sea level, 
                    <i>starting with a step up</i> from sea level and <i>ending with a step down</i> to sea level.</li>
                <li>A <i>valley</i> is a non-empty sequence of consecutive steps <i>below</i> sea level, 
                    <i>starting with a step down</i> from sea level and <i>ending with a step up</i> to sea level.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Given Gary's sequence of up and down steps during his last hike, find and print the number of valleys he walked through.</p>
